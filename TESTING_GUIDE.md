### Screenshot Checklist

For each screenshot, ensure visible:
- ‚úÖ CRUD toolbar with New, Save, Delete, Refresh buttons
- ‚úÖ Status combobox (for entities with workflows)
- ‚úÖ Grid showing data
- ‚úÖ Detail form with fields
- ‚úÖ Success/error notifications if applicable

### Expected Results

All CRUD operations should work:
- ‚úÖ **Create (New)**: Creates new entity, clears form, initializes with defaults
- ‚úÖ **Read**: Grid displays entities, form shows selected entity details
- ‚úÖ **Update (Save)**: Saves changes, shows success notification
- ‚úÖ **Delete**: Removes entity or shows dependency error
- ‚úÖ **Refresh**: Reloads data from database

## Automated Testing

### Run Playwright Tests
```bash
./run-playwright-tests.sh mock
```

Expected: All tests pass, screenshots generated in `target/screenshots/`

### Run Comprehensive Tests
```bash
./run-playwright-tests.sh comprehensive
```

Expected: All CRUD operations tested across multiple entity types

## Common Issues

### Issue: Application won't start
**Solution:** Check if port 8080 is in use: `lsof -i :8080`

### Issue: CRUD buttons not visible
**Check:**
1. Is the entity service initialized?
2. Is currentBinder set correctly?
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Issue: Delete button always disabled
**Check:**
1. Is the entity saved (has ID)?
2. Is dependency checker configured?

### Issue: Status combobox not appearing
**Check:**
1. Does entity implement IHasStatusAndWorkflow?
2. Is workflow configured for entity type?

## Reporting Results

After testing, update the PR with:
1. ‚úÖ Compilation status
2. ‚úÖ Test results summary
3. üì∏ Screenshots showing CRUD operations working
4. ‚ùå Any issues found (with details)
