### 4. Reorganized Documentation Structure

**Before:**
```
derbent/
├── README.md
├── 15+ temporary implementation summary files
├── Various fix and improvement documents
└── docs/
    ├── Some implementation docs
    ├── Some component-specific docs
    └── SQL debugging docs
```

**After:**
```
derbent/
├── README.md (enhanced)
├── AGENTS.md
└── docs/
    ├── architecture/          # 4 core pattern docs
    │   ├── entity-inheritance-patterns.md
    │   ├── service-layer-patterns.md
    │   ├── view-layer-patterns.md
    │   └── coding-standards.md
    ├── development/           # 3 developer guides
    │   ├── copilot-guidelines.md
    │   ├── getting-started.md
    │   └── project-structure.md
    ├── implementation/        # Implementation details
    ├── testing/              # Testing documentation
    ├── archive/              # Obsolete docs
    └── SQL debugging docs (3 files)
```
