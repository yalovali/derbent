# Authentication Mechanism Implementation - Summary

## What Was Implemented

This implementation solves the multi-tenant authentication problem where users can have the same username across different companies. The solution passes the selected company ID from the login form through the Spring Security authentication chain.

## Changes Made

### New Classes Created

1. **`CCompanyAwareAuthenticationToken.java`**
   - Custom authentication token that extends `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken`
   - Carries the company ID throughout the authentication process

2. **`CCompanyAwareAuthenticationProvider.java`**
   - Custom authentication provider that validates credentials with company context
   - Calls `CUserService.loadUserByUsernameAndCompany()` with company ID
   - Uses `@Lazy` injection for PasswordEncoder to avoid circular dependency

3. **`CCompanyAwareAuthenticationFilter.java`**
   - Custom filter that extends `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter`
   - Extracts company ID from the login form POST request
   - Creates `CCompanyAwareAuthenticationToken` with company context

### Modified Classes

4. **`CSecurityConfig.java`**
   - Integrated custom authentication filter and provider
   - Updated documentation to reflect new authentication flow
   - Added `configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder)` method

5. **`CUserService.java`**
   - Added new method: `loadUserByUsernameAndCompany(String username, Long companyId)`
   - Allows authentication without requiring an active session
   - Original method preserved for backward compatibility

6. **`CCustomLoginView.java`**
   - Modified `handleLogin()` to include company ID in form submission
   - Validates that a company is selected before submission

### Documentation Created

7. **`docs/implementation/LOGIN_AUTHENTICATION_MECHANISM.md`**
   - Comprehensive documentation of the authentication mechanism
   - Class hierarchy diagrams
   - Step-by-step authentication flow
   - Design decisions and security considerations
   - Troubleshooting guide

## How It Works

```
User Login Flow:
1. User selects company from dropdown
2. User enters username and password
3. Form submits with companyId parameter
4. CCompanyAwareAuthenticationFilter intercepts request
5. Creates CCompanyAwareAuthenticationToken with company ID
6. CCompanyAwareAuthenticationProvider validates credentials
7. Calls CUserService.loadUserByUsernameAndCompany(username, companyId)
8. User is authenticated with correct company context
9. Session is created and user is redirected
```

## Testing

The implementation has been:
- ✅ Compiled successfully
- ✅ Application starts without errors
- ✅ Code formatted with Spotless
- ⏳ Awaiting manual/automated login testing

## Key Benefits

1. **Multi-Tenant Support**: Users with same username can exist in different companies
2. **Session Independence**: Authentication works before session is established
3. **Security**: Maintains company isolation during authentication
4. **Backward Compatible**: Existing code continues to work
5. **Documented**: Comprehensive documentation for future maintenance

## Next Steps

1. Manual testing of login flow
2. Create automated Playwright tests
3. Consider implementing role-based authentication from user entity
4. Add audit logging for authentication attempts
