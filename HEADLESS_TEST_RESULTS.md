# Headless Integration Test Results

## Test Execution Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-11 (Updated - Authentication Manager Fix)
**Test Type:** Integration Test (No Browser Required)
**Test File:** `CLoginIntegrationTest.java`

## Authentication Manager Fix

**Issue Fixed:** NullPointerException when AuthenticationManager was null during login attempt.

**Root Cause:** The `AuthenticationManager` was not properly configured before the custom authentication filter attempted to use it.

**Solution:** Added `http.authenticationProvider(companyAwareAuthenticationProvider)` before calling `super.configure(http)` to ensure the authentication provider is registered early in the configuration process.

**File Modified:** `src/main/java/tech/derbent/login/service/CSecurityConfig.java`

The authentication manager null pointer error has been resolved. The application now properly:
- Registers the authentication provider before HttpSecurity is built
- Provides a valid AuthenticationManager to the custom authentication filter
- Allows successful login without NPE
